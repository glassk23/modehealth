            <p class="left">Small business owners have been left behind to navigate the highly volatile world of healthcare financing and employee benefits, often unsure of the motivations of brokers, insurers and wellness services. The lack of transparency creates a muddy view that owners typically prefer
            to avoid or don’t have the time to strategically address on their own with the intense demands of running a successful small business. Business owners can take charge by arming employees with the tools to be high performing, confident healthcare consumers.</p>
            
            <p class="right">At Mode Health, we believe that positive health goes beyond the healthcare insurance product. We believe that health benefits should be cost-efficient for the long run, not rack up unnecessary expenses. We believe that every employee and organization has unique needs, and their benefits plans should meet them. We are relentless in the pursuit of a personalized experience. Clients are able to tailor plans that fit their specific needs, and consistently adjust to the industry’s ebb and flow to remain a market leader.</p>

                CLIENTS OF MODE HEALTH:
                <br>
                • Understand the importance of holistic health. They focus on prevention and precondition management, rather than reactionary healthcare.
                <br><br>
                • Choose customization over one-size-fits-all solutions. They don’t run cookie-cutter businesses, so they don’t settle for cookie-cutter benefits.
            </p>
            <p class="right2">
                <br>
                • Prioritize value over cost. They understand the importance of cost-effective healthcare for their organization and employees alike.
                <br><br>

            <p class="container">Eric is a catalyst for change. Through a multi-faceted, <br>two-decade healthcare career, he developed a unique perspective on personal well-being, as well as healthcare navigation and payer systems. This experience inspired Eric to introduce an innovative approach to employee benefits through Mode Health–putting employers and employees in charge of their own care.<br><br>
                
            Eric believes that employee benefits should be a tool to achieve the optimal employee experience. Today, he helps modern, forward-thinking business leaders develop strategies that create value and accelerate company performance through a three-step process. <br><br>
                
            “The healthcare continuum lacks transparency and has significant pain points,” Eric says. “Most of us in the healthcare system are frustrated: healthcare providers with how they’re paid for services, employers with how they buy benefits and employees with insurance products that don’t fit their unique personal health needs. Yet year after year, employers engage in the same painful renewal process. It’s time to demand better and take charge with a strategy that fits our own unique mode.”</p>

            <p class="right3">For years, small business owners have tried to work around conventional health plans. Mode Health puts you in charge of your benefits plan. For small businesses, independent contractors and sole proprietors especially, effective health benefits start with identifying their organization’s specific needs, and tailoring a plan around that. (Not the other way around.) With customization at the forefront, employers are able to cut costs, recruit and retain employees, see increased performance and find a plan that works for them, for a change.</p>
